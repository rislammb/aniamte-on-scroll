            This is the Book about which there is no doubt, a guidance for those
            conscious of Allah.

          <h3>Quran Majid | Aal-E-Imran 03:64</h3>
          <p>
            Say “O People of the Scripture, come to a word that is equitable
            between us and you- that we will not worship except Allah and not
            associate anything with Him and not take one another as lords
            instead of Allah.” But if they turn away, then say, “Bear witness
            that we are Muslims [submitting to Him].”

          <p>
            Indeed, the religion in the sight of Allah is Islam. And those who
            were given the Scripture did not differ except after knowledge had
            come to them- out of jealous animosity between themselves. And
            whoever disbelieves in the verses of Allah, then indeed, Allah is
            swift in [taking] account.

          <p>
            And who is more unjust than one who invents about Allah untruth
            while he is being invited to Islam. And Allah does not guide the
            wrongdoing people.
